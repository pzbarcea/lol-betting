# lol-betting
- Ultimate goal is to create a website to bet on League of Legends matches.

- Uses Node.js backend to process requests, and Riot Games Api to get info on matches

- Should also use some database at some point (maybe MongoDB, but TBD.)


Currently working from this tutorial: https://losikov.medium.com/backend-api-server-development-with-node-js-from-scratch-to-production-fe3d3b860003 to figure out how to build the backend

## PROGRESS:
